In 2013 I had the opportunity to [speak at several great conferences](/speaking/ "Matthew Morey speaking engagements"), each was unique and offered a great way to further my knowledge while giving a little bit back to the community. As a result of the frequent travel I began optimizing what I bring to conferences: MacBook Pro, presenter remote, mic <sup>[1](#1)</sup>, webcam <sup>[2](#2)</sup>, Airport Express, various dongles, power supply, business cards, and probably a lot more I'm forgetting about.

To further reduce my traveling load I built [Wrist Presenter](http://wristpresenter.com/ "Website for iOS, Android, and Pebble app Wrist Presenter"), a mobile app that lets you control presentations wirelessly with your Pebble Smartwatch. Instead of purchasing an expensive wireless remote, lugging around a laptop, and remembering to bring all of it's required accessories, I can now just use what I always have on me, my iPhone and Pebble Smartwatch.

Thanks to my friend [Andy Dyer](http://andydyer.org/ "Personal website for Andy Dyer") who built the Android version of Wrist Presenter, this will be my first personal project launching on 3 completely different platforms (iOS, Android, and Pebble) at the same time.

The companion Pebble app communicates with the smartphone app via Bluetooth and from my testing I have not seen any connectivity issues. But with any RF technology I get skittish about charging customers for something that most likely is out of my control when it doesn't work. Therefore the app is free to try but cost $9.99 to use it with any real presentation (more than 5 slides). I'm not a fan of artificial pay walls and really didn't want to go this route but I can't think of a better way to commercialize this business.

I much rather let people just try the app for free, ensure everything works, make sure they like it, and only then let them buy it.

I commissioned my friend [Kaitlen Perkins](http://kaitlenperkins.com/ "Personal website for Kaitlen Perkins") to make the app icon. She did a great job turning my icon ideas into something realistic and functional.

I kept the name generic, instead of something Pebble specific, so other smartwatches can be added to the app in the future.

Wrist Presenter is available for free on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wrist-presenter-wireless-presentation/id735128848?mt=8&amp;at=10l6oV&amp;ct=mm_wrist-presenter "Download Wrist Presenter iOS app for free") and on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dandydev.wristpresenter "Download Wrist Presenter Android app for free").

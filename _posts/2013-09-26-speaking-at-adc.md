I will be speaking at [App Developer Conference (ADC)](http://www.schedule.adconf.com/session-id/825202?_mc=EM_DB_LE_AD13MRKAA10 "ADC conference focusing on development, UI, marketing, and business of apps.") in Los Angeles, CA in November on new opportunities with wearable technology.

As the Pebble watch and other wearable devices become ubiquitous new opportunities for innovative user interaction and functionality are being created. I will be talking about the technical capabilities of the current leading wearable devices and how those capabilities can be leveraged to create unique user experiences, especially when paired with smart phones.

Tickets are still [available](http://www.adconf.com/attend/passes.html "ADC conference tickets").

As [mentioned previously](/altconf-2014/), I will be in San Francisco during the week of WWDC. On Thursday, I will be helping [Saul](https://twitter.com/casademora) and [Marcus](https://twitter.com/mzarra) out with the [AltLabs Core Data lab](http://www.altconf.com/altlabs/) and would love for you to drop by with your questions. If that time slot doesn't work for you feel free to [get in touch](http://twitter.com/xzolian) and we can schedule another time during the week.

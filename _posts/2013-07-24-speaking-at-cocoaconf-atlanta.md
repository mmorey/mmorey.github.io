I will be speaking at [CocoaConf](http://cocoaconf.com/atlanta-2013/home "CocoaConf conference for iPhone, iPad, and Mac developers") in Atlanta, GA in November on high performance Core Data. The talk will cover various tools, model optimization, and various high performance concurrency models.

As a previous CocoaConf attendee I'm very fortunate to be a part of such a high quality conference.

CocoaConf is unique in that it is a much more intimate conference. This is a good thing as it allows you meet everyone and make lasting relationships.

Tickets are [affordable](http://cocoaconf.com/atlanta-2013/register "CocoaConf Atlanta tickets"), I hope to see you in Atlanta.

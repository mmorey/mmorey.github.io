Unfortunately I will not be attending WWDC this year but I will be in San Francisco all week working, hanging out with friends, and attending [AltConf](http://www.altconf.com/). The whole [AltConf schedule](http://www.altconf.com/speakers/) looks great but here are some talks that I'm really looking forward to:

#### Monday
* __Brent Simmons (14:45 - 15:15) - Implementing Sync In Vesper__: After following his great [Vesper Sync series](http://inessential.com/2014/05/24/vesper_sync_diary_follow-up) I'm hoping his talk serves as a great summary and wrap up.
* __Dave Wiskus (15:15 - 15:45) - Thoughts on Design within HIGs__: The [HIG](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556) often feels restrictive but those restrictions usually keep us from creating sub-par user experiences. As our community matures I expect to see more designs that push the boundaries of what the HIG says is good design. I often forget the HIG is full of guidelines not rules, maybe Dave's talk will serve as a good reminder.

#### Tuesday
* __Boris BÃ¼gling (13:00 - 13:30) - Extending Xcode__: I'm currently doing a [30 day AppCode trial run](https://twitter.com/xzolian/status/469496773895917568) but I'm fairly certain I will always have Xcode open when doing Cocoa development. Anything that improves the time I spend in Xcode is worth checking out.
* __Mark Pauley (13:30 - 14:00) - The Real Power of BLE__: I'm still waiting for a real world application of BLE or iBeacons that impresses me. Maybe Mark has something to show me?

#### Wednesday
* __Sam Marshall (14:00 - 14:30) - Insecure Code__: NSA, Target, Heartbleed, and so on, security is important. Do right by your users, attend this talk.
* __Mikey Ward (15:45 - 16:15) - XPC What I Did There?__: Mikey is a great teacher and I don't know much about XPC so this is a logical choice for me.

#### Thursday
* __Michele Titolo (14:45 - 15:15) - Demystifying The .xcodeproj File__: The more you know about your tools the stronger engineer you will be.

#### Friday

* __Philippe Casgrain (10:00 - 10:30) - Fostering a Local Development Community__: I have started helping out with the [San Diego iOS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/sdiosdevelopers/) and could use all the advice I can get. I'm a Cocoa developer partly because of the wonderful community we have, lets keep it strong.
* __Jonathan Rhyne (13:30 - 14:00) - TBA__: I attended his [talk](http://vimeo.com/75362236) at last years 360iDev and picked up some great legal information about liability, contracts, and working with friends. 
* __Thomas Engel (14:00 - 14:30) - Volunteering and Tackling World Problems with Your Skills__: I have never used my Cocoa skills in a volunteering capacity but I do think it is important. Hopefully Thomas will help me find some new volunteering opportunities.

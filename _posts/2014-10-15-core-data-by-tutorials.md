So I finally wrote a book.

[Core Data by Tutorials: iOS 8 and Swift Edition](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/core-data-tutorials-ios-8-swift-edition?source=matthewmorey) is available now. I would love for you to purchase it or send it to friends who might enjoy it.

#### Table of Contents:

<ul>
<li><em>Chapter 1, Your First Core Data App</em>: You’ll click File\New Project and write a Core Data app from scratch! This chapter covers the basics of setting up your data model and then adding and fetching records.</li>
<li><em>Chapter 2, NSManagedObject Subclasses</em>: NSManagedObject is the base data storage class of your Core Data object graphs. This chapter will teach you how you customize your own managed object subclasses to store and validate data.</li>
<li><em>Chapter 3, The Core Data Stack</em>: Under the hood, Core Data is made up of many parts working together. In this chapter, you’ll learn about how these parts fit together, and move away from the starter Xcode template to build your own customizable system.</li>
<li><em>Chapter 4, Intermediate Fetching</em>: Your apps will fetch data all the time, and Core Data offers many options for getting the data to you efficiently. This chapter covers more advanced fetch requests, predicates, sorting and asynchronous fetching.</li>
<li><em>Chapter 5, NSFetchedResultsController</em>: Table views are at the core of many iOS apps, and Apple wants to make Core Data play nicely with them! In this chapter, you’ll learn how NSFetchedResultsController can save you time and code when your table views are backed by data from Core Data.</li>
<li><em>Chapter 6, Versioning and Migration</em>: As you update and enhance your app, its data model will almost certainly need to change. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create multiple versions of your data model and then migrate your users forward so they can keep their existing data as they upgrade.</li>
<li><em>Chapter 7, Syncing with iCloud</em>: Move beyond storing data locally on a single device, to cloud storage and synchronizing across all the user’s devices. This chapter covers how to extend an existing Core Data app to use iCloud.</li>
<li><em>Chapter 8, Unit Tests</em>: Testing is an important part of the development process, and you shouldn’t leave Core Data out of those tests! In this chapter, you’ll learn how to set up a separate test environment for Core Data and see examples of how to test your models.</li>
<li><em>Chapter 9, Measuring and Boosting Performance</em>: No one ever complained that an app was too fast, so it’s important to be vigilant about tracking performance. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to measure your app’s performance with various Xcode tools and then pick up some tips for dealing with slow spots in your code. </li>
<li><em>Chapter 10, Multiple Managed Object Contexts</em>: In this final chapter, you’ll expand the usual Core Data stack to include multiple managed object contexts. You’ll learn how this can improve perceived performance and help make your app architecture less monolithic and more compartmentalized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently I had the honor of presenting at the March <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Houston-iPhone-Developers-Meetup/events/105167792/" title="Houston iPhone Developers Meetup">Houston iOS Developers Meetup</a> event on Core Data and multiple managed object contexts (MOC).</p>

<p>When using Core Data for persisting app data multiple MOCs are often required to avoid blocking UI. Typically you would create a background MOC and listen for changes on the main MOC, merging changes as necessary. With iOS 5, MOCs now have parent context and the ability to set concurrency types. These new features greatly simplify dealing with Core Data on background queues.</p>

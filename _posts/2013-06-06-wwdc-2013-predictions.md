I posted my 2013 WWDC predictions on the ChaiONE [blog](http://www.chaione.com/wwdc-2013-predictions-an-ios-developers-pov/ "WWDC 2013 predictions"). Nothing crazy, just the obvious:

* No new iOS hardware
* Intel Haswell based systems
* iOS 7 redesign
* Better support for third party wearable devices (Pebble smart watch)

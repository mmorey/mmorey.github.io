I will be speaking at this years [SecondConf](http://www.secondconf.com/ "SecondConf technology conference") in Chicago, IL in September on the Pebble Watch iOS SDK. The talk will cover the technical capabilities of the Pebble and what you can achieve when you connect your iPhone to it. The talk will be similar to what I plan on speaking about at [360i|Dev]({% post_url 2013-05-04-speaking-at-2013-360idev %} "Speaking at 360i|Dev") but will have additional content and discuss the consumer experience of wearable technology.

The single track schedule looks pretty good. I'm particularly interested in [Saul Mora's](http://saulmora.com/ "Saul Mora's personal website") talk on Teaching Kids to Code and [Bob Kressin's](https://twitter.com/macisv "Twitter site for Bob Kressin") talk on Bluetooth Low Energy.

Tickets cost [$595](https://secondconf2013.eventbrite.com/ "SecondConf tickets"), I hope to see you in Chicago.

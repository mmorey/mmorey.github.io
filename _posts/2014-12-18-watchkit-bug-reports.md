While writing the notifications chapter for the [WatchKit by Tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/watchkit-by-tutorials?source=matthewmorey) book I have filed several notification related bug reports. Here is the consolidated list :

* More than 1 notification scene, with different categories, causes Illegal Configuration error [19298824](http://openradar.appspot.com/19298824)
* Adding a WatchKit App Target with Notifications and/or Glances enabled should automatically create the necessary build schemes. [19226774](http://openradar.appspot.com/19226774)
* Extensions should be able to schedule Local Notifications [19185621](http://openradar.appspot.com/19185621)
* It should be possible to test the Short-Look notification Interface in the simulator.[19170384](http://openradar.appspot.com/19170384)

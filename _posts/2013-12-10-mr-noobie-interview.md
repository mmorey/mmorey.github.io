I was a guest on [@mrnoobie's](https://twitter.com/mrnoobie) 95.9 FM [Tech Talk show](http://www.noobie.com/2013/12/09/the-next-big-trend-wearable-technology/ "Tech Talk podcast with Mr. Noobie") where I talked about some popular wearable technology devices including various smart glasses and smart watches. I'm on at the 11:42 mark.

During the interview I mentioned my upcoming iOS and Pebble app Wrist Presenter. If you would like to help improve the product and test it out send me an [email](mailto:me@matthewmorey.com).

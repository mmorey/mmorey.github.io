Does your "day job" not allow you to get away with wearing t-shirts, flip-flops, and board shorts? No worries, you can take the Kook Wear vibe into the office with our polo. It's a simple design featuring our globe logo and tag line. Our polo features a luxurious blend of 70% bamboo and 30% organic cotton. This mix of sustainable fabrics makes it one of the most environmentally friendly poloâ€™s available. Bamboo needs little water to grow and converts CO2 green house gas very efficiently. There is no sacrifice in comfort either, bamboo is soft and wicks very well. Everyday you wear this shirt it will feel like casual Friday.

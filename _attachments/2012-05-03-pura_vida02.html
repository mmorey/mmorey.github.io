Pura vida, the unofficial motto of Costa Rica. Literally translated as 'pure life', pura vida is the phrase most commonly associated with Costa Rica. It embodies a philosophy in which communal ties are strong and close; difficulties are overcome with a resilient and happy spirit, where life is enjoyed leisurely and to the fullest, and where fortune of whatever size is heartily celebrated. There is nothing like staring out at the lineup during an incredible sunrise right before a day filled with surfing and soul searching.

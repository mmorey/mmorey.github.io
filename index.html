            I'm an engineer, hacker, creator, author, and leader who is on a quest to change the world with technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            A native to Florida, I attended the University of Florida, graduating with a BS and MS degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. During school I specialized in high performance computing and was awarded a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8218792?oq=matthew+morey">patent</a> for some of my research.
          </p>

          <p>
            After school I worked on safety critical microcontrollers for Texas Instruments (TI) as a Product Engineer and later an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js-Vuk72t7Q">Applications Engineer</a>. The MCUs I worked on are used in many life saving applications such as  anti-lock brakes and airbags. They are even in the <a href="https://rotorcraft.arc.nasa.gov/Publications/files/Balaram_AIAA2018_0023.pdf">Mars Helicopter Ingenuity</a>. My work at TI instilled the importance of quality and doing things the right way.

            With the release of the iPhone I was inspired to create mobile apps for some of my passions. I had a big hit with my first app, <a href="http://buoyexplorer.com/">Buoy Explorer</a>, which provides marine weather conditions for surfers and other water sports enthusiasts. When the Pebble smart watch came out I released <a href="http://wristpresenter.com/">Wrist Presenter</a> so that I could control presentations from my watch.
          </p>

          <p>
            Along the way I have enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8ggtwNTaM">speaking</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2XW7z1x">writing books</a> on mobile development and engineering.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recently I have been building and leading the engineering team at <a href="https://www.mjdinteractive.com/">MJD Interactive</a> as CTO and Partner. At MJD we focus on building digital experiences for theme parks, retailers, and consumer electronics brands such as Disney, GoPro, The Container Store, and Levi's.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the non-profit Save the Waves I built the <a href="https://www.savethewaves.org/mobileapp/">Endangered Waves platform</a>. Empowering surfers and beach lovers to become real-time coastal stewards, and turning everyday global citizens into citizen scientists.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently I'm growing a technology team around connected experiences at <a href="https://www.valtech.com/services/connected-experiences/">Valtech</a>.
